📊 Level 3 – Task 5: Correlation Analysis
📌 Overview

This task focuses on performing correlation analysis as part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The objective is to identify relationships between numerical variables and understand how they influence each other within the dataset.

🎯 Objective

Analyze relationships between numerical features

Identify positive, negative, and weak correlations

Gain insights useful for feature selection and data understanding

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

🔍 Task Description (What We Did)

Loaded and explored the dataset

Selected relevant numerical columns

Computed the correlation matrix using Pearson correlation

Visualized correlations using a heatmap

Interpreted relationships between variables to understand data patterns

📊 Key Insights

Strong positive correlations indicate variables that increase together

Negative correlations show inverse relationships

Some features displayed weak or no correlation, indicating independence
